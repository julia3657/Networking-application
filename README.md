# Networking-application
Our chatting application switches, upon user input, between a TCP and UDP connection to send files and messages respectively.
To begin, click on the "Send File" button if you would like to send a file, which opens a secure and reliable TCP connection capable of
sending any file to a desired reciever.

Alternatively, you may click on the "Send Message" button if you would like to send a simple message. This opens a UDP connection,
supported by many reliablility checks (such as retransmissioning, checksum, acking, and more). You and your partner will be able to
chat until one of you chooses to quit the application, which can be done by typing "quit".
